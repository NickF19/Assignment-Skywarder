// Assumptions:
//      Calibration : we assume that the update function will be called for some steps before the liftoff
//      Lift-off :  we assume that the liftoff will happen at the moment of the first and huge delta acceleration.
//      Apogee :    we assume to be the point when the barometer reaches the maximum value.
//      Landing :   we assume that the landing is when the barometer, the acceleration and gyros stabilize
//                  also, it can be assumed that a "spike" on acceleration due to touch-down is detectable.
//      Sensors:    The sensor variance/error is considered, while it is not taken any cleaning procedure for outliers.
//                  Therefore, for now, outliers may trigger liftoff and apogee
